**Description**  
Remote sensing is the collection and analysis of spatial data through the 
observation and scanning of large areas from a distance. The applications of remote
sensing in anthropology and archaeology are extensive, including site and feature prospection, mapping, 
topographic analysis, hydrological analysis, 3D modeling, subsurface imaging, 
vegetation, soil classification, among others. This course discusses the history and 
theory of the use of remote sensing of cultural landscapes. The class will explore the use and 
analysis of remote sensing datasets from aerial photography, satellite imagery, 
laser scanning, radar, and thermal sensors to interpret archaeological sites, landscapes, 
land cover change, land use, and other environmental applications. 
In addition to assessing case studies of remote sensing applications in anthropology, 
students will learn how to collect, preprocess, process, visualize, and analyze data. 
The course will also address ethical considerations in conducting remote sensing research.

**Course Objectives**  
By the end of the course, students will:
1. be able to explain the principles, fundamentals, and applications of remote sensing for spatial analysis in anthropology and other disciplines.
2. know how to access and analyze satellite and other remote sensing data for anthropological and environmental applications.
3. become familiar with processing remote sensing data across several platforms, including ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Agisoft Metashape, LAStools, Google Earth Engine, R, and Python.
4. be able to evaluate and develop workflows for specific remote sensing analyses, from data collection to preprocessing, classification, and accuracy assessment.
5. consider the ethical ramifications of their work and the challenges facing the use and collection of remote sensing data in the twenty-first century.

**Prerequisites**  
This class has no prerequisites, but some previous knowledge of GIS, coding, and photography will be beneficial.

**Attendance and Participation**  
Attendance is crucial to get the most out of this course. 
If you must miss a class meeting, please let me know by email 
or in person as soon as possible. I encourage you to discuss 
what you missed with another student or attend my office hours. 
Participation includes engagement during lectures and contributions to discussions. 
Requirements for class attendance and make-up exams, assignments, 
and other work in this course are consistent with university policies 
(<https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies>).

**Readings**  
Readings will be posted on the course website and should be completed before the
relevant class period. A goal of this course is to create a resource that students can use to learn 
about remote sensing, so feel free to contribute additional readings in the context of that week’s topic.

**Labs**  
Every class period will have a lab component to introduce topics and techniques.
We will use example data in class, and students will be required to conduct the same analyses
on their own data relevant to their final project. Lab work will continue outside of class and will be presented the following week. The results of these labs will be posted on the
Canvas discussion board prior to the next class meeting.

**Final Project**  
Students will develop a project throughout the semester. After the first class meeting
students will select a research site/area, ideally related to their dissertation or 
thesis project, to be posted as a Google Earth .kml file to the class blog. The next 
phase of the project will be the crafting of a research question. The final project will 
be a proposal and preliminary analysis of your research area, using methods and tools 
learned in class. If the data needed to address your research question are not available, 
discuss how you would realistically plan to acquire such data. Students will present 
project updates prior to final submission during the last two weeks of class.

**Academic Honesty and Integrity**  
Please be familiar with the University of Florida’s Student Honor Code: 
<https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/policies/student-honor-code-student-conduct-code>

**Special Accommodations**  
The process for requesting special accommodations is described at 
<https://disability.ufl.edu/get-started>, including registering with the 
Disability Resource Center in Reid Hall and requesting an accommodation 
letter to be presented to the instructor.

**Online Course Evaluation**  
Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on 
the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations 
online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional 
and respectful manner is available at <https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students>. 
Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens and can complete 
evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas 
course menu under GatorEvals, or via <https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl>. Summaries of 
course evaluation results are available to students at
