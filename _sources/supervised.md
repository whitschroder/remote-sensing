# Supervised and Unsupervised Land Cover Classification

In this lab, we will conduct supervised and unsupervised land cover classifications of Landsat satellite imagery.

## Supervised Classification in QGIS

In QGIS, under Plugins, install the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin and restart QGIS. If you receive an error message, you may need to upgrade some dependencies. If so, open the OSGEO4W Shell and run the following command:

```
pip3 install --upgrade remotior-sensus scikit-learn torch
```

After restarting QGIS, an SCP toolbar should now be available.
